# Marketing Copy Generator — Technical Documentation

## 1. Implementation Architecture

The application is a Flask-based web tool that interfaces with OpenAI’s GPT-4 Turbo API to generate marketing copy. The user inputs parameters such as prompt type, tone, product, and audience through a simple web form. These inputs populate pre-defined prompt templates stored in `prompts.json`. The backend constructs the prompt, sends it to the OpenAI API, and returns the generated content to the frontend.

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `app.py`: Core Flask app handling routes, API calls, and logic.
- `templates/index.html`: Frontend user interface using Jinja templating.
- `static/styles.css`: Styling for the UI.
- `prompts.json`: Library of prompt templates optimized for different marketing content.
- `sample_outputs/`: Folder containing sample generated texts.
- `comparison_matrix.md`: Analysis of prompt variations.
- `docs/technical_doc.md`: This document.

The app uses environment variables to securely manage the OpenAI API key. Input validation is minimal but ensures required fields are filled. Output is displayed in a textarea for easy copying.

## 2. API Selection Rationale

OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo was selected for its combination of state-of-the-art language generation, speed, and cost-efficiency. GPT-4 Turbo provides:

- High-quality, coherent text generation suitable for marketing copy.
- Support for complex prompt engineering.
- Robust performance under high loads.
- Flexible pricing that balances quality and usage cost.

Alternative APIs (e.g., GPT-3.5, Cohere) were considered but GPT-4 Turbo’s superior output quality and support for chat-based completion made it the best choice.

## 3. Prompt Engineering Methodology

A library of 5 prompt templates was created to cover common marketing copy needs: product descriptions, Instagram captions, LinkedIn posts, email subject lines, and YouTube descriptions.

The methodology included:

- Using placeholders for tone, product, audience, and optional extra info to allow flexibility.
- Iterative testing of prompts by varying tone and context.
- Evaluating outputs for clarity, engagement, relevance, and brand voice.
- Documenting variations and results in the `comparison_matrix.md` file to refine prompt structures.
- Keeping prompts concise but specific enough to guide the model effectively.

## 4. Performance Optimization Techniques

- Prompt templates reduce token usage by avoiding overly verbose inputs.
- Temperature is set to 0.8 to balance creativity with coherence.
- Maximum tokens per request are capped at 250 to control cost and response time.
- Reusing prompt templates avoids frequent prompt re-writing, enhancing speed.
- Caching and saving results can be implemented for frequent queries (future improvement).

## 5. Limitation Management Strategies

- Input validation prevents empty or malformed inputs.
- Error handling captures API timeouts, rate limits, and invalid keys, displaying user-friendly messages.
- Rate limits and usage costs are documented and monitored to avoid unexpected charges.
- Output filtering can be enhanced by integrating content moderation APIs to prevent inappropriate content.
- The system warns users of API errors or delays and suggests retrying.
